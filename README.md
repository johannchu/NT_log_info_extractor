# NT_log_info_extractor
This program is a supplement to the Intelligent Tutoring System, Newton's Tablet, developed by Mr. Levi Lindsay in the Smart Tools Lab of the Department of Mechanical Engineering in University of California, Riverside. The program can load in the log files generated by Newton's Tablet and concatenate them into one single temp file, which can then be interpreted to see whether the user had completed each individual part in NT. We can then use the results to grade the students' work accordingly.
